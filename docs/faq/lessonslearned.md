# What I have learned for undertaking this project

All I wanted to do was just make AI art in the style of my favorite shows. Just wanted to cook something up in-between my odd jobs and video game sessions. What I got instead was a journey through several different fields of work, disciplines within art photography and animation, and the roughness of the math and science behind what we all call AI. 
I learn a lot of python and CUDA, sometimes had to cheat with ChatGPT but was able to recognize how to get things working.
I learned a lot about Blu-Ray content. The encoding process of fanrips, streaming services, and the physical delivery of the media all playing a part in the quality of the viewing experience and how that was affecting tools I used when curating my dataset from these sources.
Getting a refresher on various art concepts and terminology so I could better recognize concepts when tagging my dataset.
And while doing all of this dataset creation and compiling, I learned a lot about the animation creation process, from genga drawing to digital coloring to CGI set pieces to the final finish that goes on the silver screen or your living room television.
I think I learned more about all these other fields and discipline than I did the back end of the AI generative creation process, but I can now easily recognize how to take what I have learned and translate it to working on LLMs for textgen models or maybe even audiogen models. And as I continue to grow this model, and improve my access to hardware, I hope to continuing learn more and creating more with AI.
